# since it was too dark, improving the normalization we get this:

# now we'll add false color mapping, volume, a minimal N-body simulator with gravity and initial velocities based on dipole flow with large-scale anisotropies

# After 100 steps, we get something like this:

which is cool to watch but not ideal, the sphere is still hollow, the particles are not as granular as they should be and there is a fork on the road of decisions here:

1. Fill the sphere and make the particles more granular
2. Go for a holographic projection

I'll try both approaches, see which one yields the more promissing results, afterwards, I'm thinking of saving the dataset and moving to a CUDA simulation to support a more robust particle system, which should scale quite nicely

# filling the sphere based on the data on the surface from its surface resulted in this:

Which is nice, but it most certainly makes me want to introduce smoothed oarticle hydrodynamics to it

After further attempts, Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics seems to provide a more stable fluid dynamics solution

After adding ISPH it was needed to introduce Barnesâ€“Hut Gravity since the complexity was too high

BHG's octree keeps subdividing indefinitely lead to a recurssion error
