# since it was too dark, improving the normalization we get this:

# now we'll add false color mapping, volume, a minimal N-body simulator with gravity and initial velocities based on dipole flow with large-scale anisotropies

# After 100 steps, we get something like this:

which is cool to watch but not ideal, the sphere is still hollow, the partcile are not as granular and there is a fork on the road of decisions here:

1. Fill the sphere and make the particles more granular
2. Go for a holographic projection
